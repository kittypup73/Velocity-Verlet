# Velocity-Verlet
This project simulates a two-body system — a star and a planet — using a simple
numerical approach, with no external libraries for orbital mechanics. The simulation is a
demonstration of how gravitational acceleration leads to an elliptical orbit, approximated
using numerical integration (Velocity Verlet method).
